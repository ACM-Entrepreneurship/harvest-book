                        At Harvest Book, our mission is to address the pressing challenges 
                        of food waste, environmental degradation, food insecurity, and 
                        social inequality through innovative entrepreneurial solutions. 
                        We strive to create a sustainable food ecosystem that benefits 
                        everyone - from the food producers to the consumers - while 
                        giving back to the community. Our goal is to minimize food waste,
                        promote environmentally friendly practices, and combat food 
                        scarcity by sharing resources, knowledge, and technology. 
                        We believe that by harnessing the power of business, 
                        we can create meaningful change and build a better future for all.

                Our mission at HarvestBook is to create a sustainable food ecosystem
                 that benefits everyoneâ€”from your local farmers to your nearest food 
                 bank-- while also promoting awareness on ways to preserve our environment.
                  Our goal is to minimize food waste, promote environmentally friendly 
                  farming practices, and combat food scarcity by sharing resources, 
                  knowledge, and technology. We believe that by working together, 
                  we can provide sustainable and cost-effective solutions that not 
                  only reduce food waste but also benefit our economies, environment, and community. 
                  Our goal is to enable entrepreneurs and businesses to take a leading 
                  role in reducing food waste and creating a more sustainable food 
                  system for future generations.

                <p>Each year, 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted,
                    which is nearly 40% of all the food produced in the U.S. 
                    This amount of food worth approximately 1 trillion US dollars.
                    Food waste is a major issue for farmers as well, many studies estimate that 
                    nearly 30% of all food produced by farmers is wasted. Additionally, many 
                    grocery stores and supermarkets may reject edible food produced by farmers 
                    because of appearance or weight standards, which causes even more food to be 
                    thrown away

            <div className={styles.GreenBox4}> Why It Matters? </div>
            <div className={styles.text2}>
                <p>
                Food waste in the U.S. is a significant problem, with consumers alone wasting about $1,500 worth of groceries per year for a four-person household. 
                Crops are also left in fields due to mechanical harvesting practices, and food manufacturing and transportation issues contribute to the problem. 
                In addition to the economic impact, food waste has serious environmental consequences, including the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, 
                as well as wasting water, oil, and land resources. Approximately 18% of methane emissions are generated by wasted food, 
                and the amount of water wasted is equivalent to 45 trillion gallons. The food waste also costs us about 350 million barrels of oil, 
                and an estimated 1.3 billion tons of wasted food takes up valuable landfill space, using up 22% of our landfill area.

                Harvest Book is a website that provides a platform for farmers to
                 donate their excess food to charities, reducing food waste, and 
                 decay while also providing tax benefits for the farmers. 
                 By connecting farmers directly with local charities and 
                 food banks, Harvest Book streamlines the process of donating 
                 surplus crops and helps ensure that food gets to those who need 
                 it most. Additionally, farmers can receive tax benefits for 
                 donating their excess produce, providing an added incentive to 
                 participate in this sustainable and charitable initiative. With 
                 Harvest Book, farmers can easily reduce their environmental impact,
                    help their local communities, and receive financial benefits at 
                  the same time.
